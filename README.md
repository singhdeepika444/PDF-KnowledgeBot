# PDF-KnowledgeBot


PDF KnowledgeBot is an AI-powered chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), designed to help users interactively query and explore PDF documents.

This application leverages:

OpenAI API for language understanding and response generation.

LangChain and LangGraph for orchestrating RAG workflows.

FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval of information from PDF files.

Users can upload PDFs and ask questions in natural language, with the bot retrieving relevant sections and providing accurate, context-aware answers. This makes it ideal for studying, research, or quickly extracting knowledge from large documents.
